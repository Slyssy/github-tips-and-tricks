# GitHub Tips and Tricks

To create this page, I used HTML, CSS and small amount of JavaScript.

This is a responsive page set up using Flexbox with a single device breakpoint
set at 900px.

Most of the images are hosted on my google docs page. This was the first time I
ever tried doing that. I am pleased that it worked.

As of today, May 7, 2022, I still plan on adding a page to show how to create
and manage GitHub branches. The link is there, but it doesn't go anywhere.

I could still use some practice with designing layouts, but all in all, I am
pleased I was able to get it work. I am certain that I can pretty much create
anything if I had a guide. I still struggle with designing things on my own.

Practice makes perfect!
